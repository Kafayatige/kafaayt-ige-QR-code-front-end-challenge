## My process
- i drew first a wireframe to enable me understand the structure of design.
- I wrote first the structural code using HTML5.
- Outline how each element and item should relate with one another.
With my understanding of flex box and view-port i was able to add CSS component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- during the CSS part, i gained critical understanding of how defining some certain property can restrict another from being effective.
-I gained more critical understanding of how the view-port unit such as vh and vw can affect the layout of your design on different platforms.
- there was a point i initially used the flex-basis property which restricted my padding-bottom from being effective
- I learnt that there is always room for optimisation in your code



Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
     <P class="Bold-text">
             Improve your front-end <span>skills by building projects</span>
           </P>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css 
  
   .whole{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    background :hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    min-height: 100vh;
    min-width: 100vw;
    }
